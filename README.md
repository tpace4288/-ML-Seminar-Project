# -ML-Seminar-Project
This project shows how one may use ML algorithms to predict a consumer's spending habits based on features such as where they live, time of year, etc. It should be noted, however, that the data presented here is ChatGPT generated and thus creates an interesting result. The data was obtained on Kaggle.com (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/iamsouravbanerjee/customer-shopping-trends-dataset/data) and was used throughout a Data Science seminar. This was programmed in Python using pandas and numpy via Jupyter Notebook.

This project was started in order to use regression based ML models to predict a customer's spending habits at a particular business. These models used features such as location, time of year, and item purchased to predict what that customer might spend. However, because this dataset was ChatGPT genereated, we see that AI has a ways to go before replicating real-life data. Since the data was generated in such a uniform way, our models, when trained, began to predict more of an average, not necessarily accurate, spending amount. These can be seen in later images of the Jupyter notebook. In the real world, data is much more messy in which case, ML models tend to excel. We can take this project as a warning sign that AI generated data should not always be comparable to the randomn and erratic nature of data from the real world.
